# VocAmp

VocAmp is an mobile music player for Vocaloid music.
It enables the user to discover new Vocaloid music, and directly stream it (For now, just from YouTube).

**NOTE** that this project is still very much in development! _**There are practically no features yet whatsoever.**_

Data is sourced from [VocaDB](https://vocadb.net)'s API.
The project is currently targeting Android, but iOS support at a later stage is not ruled out.
